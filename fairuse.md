## Fair use

To address GitHub's growth and GHTorrent's growing demands in API calls and the
community's demand for better, more rich data, we need more GitHub API keys. We
therefore kindly ask you to [send us](mailto:gousiosg@gmail.com)
a GitHub API key (a “personal access token” as Github describes it).

The process to create a key is simple: First, go to the following URL (while
logged in):

[https://github.com/settings/tokens/new](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)

deselect *all* checkboxes *except* from `public_repo`, set a token name and
click on "Generate Token".

Please note that it is possible to specify the maximum number of requests per
hour that you would like to donate to GHTorrent. By default, GHTorrent uses the
maximum allowed by GitHub (5k/hour), but if you are using the GitHub API for
other projects/services, you might want to restrict this. A typical service like
Travis only uses a few requests per hour, even on busy projects.

**If you do not want us to use your key any more, do let us know.** Do not
just delete your key from GitHub as this will create holes in the data
collection until we notice and remove your key.
