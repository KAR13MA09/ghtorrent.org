## Setting up GHTorrent

The first thing to do is to ensure that you have a working GHTorrent
environment. To do so, please consult the top level
[README.md](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror/blob/master/README.md) file with
instructions on doing so.

## TODO list

The TODO list is maintained as a collection of open [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror). Please feel free to adopt
any of those by @mentioning the @ghtorrent user.

## New features

Do you have a cool idea that will make GHTorrent 100x (or 0.01x) better? That's
great!  We look forward to reviewing your pull requests! We however advise you
to:

1. Read the [open issue list](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror/issues)
2. Contact the [GHTorrent mailing list](). The maintainers will help you
implement your proposed feature as efficiently as possible and make sure
that it does not conflict with any change currently planned.
